# TIC-80 Cartridge Files
This repo is to easily transfer/sync and make my TIC-80 carts available at all times, including but not limited to small projects, libraries, and work-in-progress stuff.

## TIC-80 + Programming Details
 - I use Lua pretty exclusively
 - My version of TIC-80 is 1.0.2251-dev Pro (0cd38fd)
 - These are typically small, short-lived challenges or projects

### Can I use these?
Probably, check the cart's built-in license in it's header. Regardless of the license in the header, you can: download and run the cart as much as you'd like, use and modify it for personal (closed-source, undistributed) projects, and credit me if distributed. For more info, open an issue using the [License Question](https://github.com/joejoemars1/tic80-carts/issues/new?assignees=joejoemars1&labels=license&template=license-question.md&title=License+Question) template.

Quick Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and no lawyer has reviewed any of those statements, which are subject to change

### What if I don't give credit?
Well... That sucks! Not much I can actually do.

### I found a bug or glitch in a cart (and possibly fixed it), should I open a pull request and/or issue for it?
Sure, but don't count on me seeing it for... A while. I'm usually busy doing stuff or busy calming down from said stuff. Open an issue with the [Bug or Glitch](https://github.com/joejoemars1/tic80-carts/issues/new?assignees=joejoemars1&labels=bug&template=bug-or-glitch.md&title=Bug+or+Glitch) template.

### You put one of my carts in here, why?
Probably an accident, *please* open an issue for that using the [Remove my Cart](https://github.com/joejoemars1/tic80-carts/issues/new?assignees=joejoemars1&labels=copied+cart&template=remove-my-cart.md&title=Please+remove+my+cart) template. And be nice. I might cry.

### Why?
idk `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

### I have another question not listed here.
✨ Open an issue, put [other](https://github.com/joejoemars1/tic80-carts/issues/new?labels=other) as the label ✨
