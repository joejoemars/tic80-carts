# TIC-80 Cartridge Files
This repo is to easily transfer/sync and make my TIC-80 carts available at all times, including but not limited to small projects, libraries, and work-in-progress stuff.

### Can I use these?
Probably, check the cart's built-in license in it's header. Regardless of the license in the header, you can: download and run the cart as much as you'd like, use and modify it for personal (closed-source, undistributed) projects, and credit me if distributed. For more info, open an issue, put "License Question" as the title, and the question or questions as the body.

### What if I don't give credit?
Well... That sucks!

### I found a bug or glitch in a cart and fixed it, can I open a pull request or issue for it?
Sure, but don't count on me seeing it for... A while. I'm usually busy doing stuff or busy calming down.

### You put one of my carts in here, why?
Probably an accident, *do* open an issue for that, add a link to your original cart, and a link to the offending cart in the repo.

### I have another question not listed here.
✨ Open an issue ✨
